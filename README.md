## Outline for Written content *(literature for website)*
### INFORMATION ON EACH STI
#### General Info
- What is it? How does it specifically affect the body and overall health? What are the long term ramifications?
- common symptoms (and how many people often show symptoms? What are the symptoms for vagina vs penis –or AMAB/ AFAB)
- what are the stages (if any)
- how long does it take from initial exposure to show symptoms?
- how long does a person have to be infected until it can be passed to someone else?
- does it ever go away on its own?
- how is it biologically spread throughout the body? (mucosal? Fluids from sores? Saliva? blood?)
- Is there a vaccine?
#### How the Testing works? 
- Is there a clinically approved test for it(AMAB and AFAB)?
- How do medical professionals test for this specific STIs? (blood, urine, mouth swabs, genital fluid and mucus samples, pap smear)?
- How accurate are the tests for this STI?
- how long does it take from initial exposure to show up accurately on tests? Are there any discrepancies or glaring problems with testing for this STI?
- any info on false diagnosis if applicable
#### TREATMENT OPTIONS
- What are the common courses of treatment?
- What biologically happens in the body during the treatment process?
- how successful is the treatment?
	Coinfection, reinfection, male vs. female(AMAB, AFAB), 
- How long does someone have to take the treatment?
- side effects? (Drug to drug interactions? Antibiotic resistant strains? Do people have to take more than one round of antibiotics because it is not cured with the first round if applicable)




	

# data available around different acts *rabbithole/*
## Questions and Notes
1.  Which stis have vaccinations? 
    -  Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, HPV, and mpox [^3]
2. How effective are they?
3. 4 catagories of STIS
- “STDs can be divided into four categories: those that produce no mucosal signs or symptoms; those that produce varying degrees of mucosal inflammation; those that produce genital ulcers; and those that cause epithelialcell changes and/or MUCOSAL NEOPLASM (TABLE 2).” [4]
**Table 2 | Types of sexually transmitted infections** 
  - Systemic infections without mucosal disease - HIV, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus Genital 
ulcers Haemophilus ducreyi, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum 
  - Mucosal inflammation Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis Changes in epithelial cells Human papillomavirus[4]
Vaginal mucus membrane, sperm, silival(HSV1), [^1]
  - Mucosal sti (gonorrhea and chlamydia )[^1]
- *FURTHER QUESTIONS*
  - What is the mucus membrane and how is it involved in sex organs– 
  - {what do the micobiomes of the penis and vagina look like? 
  - How can these microbiomes affect susceptibility of STDs? } 
  - are some people more infectious than others? 
  - Are some people more susceptible to contracting a STI?    
  -  How do viral loads factor in? 
  -  Is the duration of the sex act  important?       
  - What are the details for contact points (oral, anal, vaginal, kissing, skin to skin contact?)
  - Does order of the sex acts factor into risk assessment?
  - Douching {personal hygiene but upsets natural ph levels of the vaginal microbiome which can increase risk of STIs, same also found in rectal douching. Both inhibit the mucosal secretions which help  protect sensitive areas from foreign infection.} [^1]
  - circumcision and the relations to sti risk? 
  - Birth control (hormonal or no hormonal– what kind [IUD, Arm implant, pills]) and relation to sti risk?
  - Reproductive tract perturbations can facilitate the ease of transmission in several ways, including mucosal disruption and increasing inflammatory dynamics (Galvin and Cohen, 2004; Nusbaum et al., 2004)[^1].
    - "In biology, a perturbation is a change in the function of a biological system, caused by internal or external factors. Perturbations can be caused by:
    Environmental stimuli: Changes in temperature, pressure, or osmotic shock
    Small molecules: Drugs or toxins that affect biological pathways
    Gene manipulation: Gene knockout or transcript knockdown by RNA interference" [^7]


# Start setting up database *outline/*
*Let our algorithm find information on all the numbers and statistics for how STIs spread. The most used and cited source for the US is the CDC. The CDC collects data from each individual state then ‘cleans it, filters it, processes it’ before it is released to the public. There are some glaring issues with this data source and by including their specific numbers would only lead to corrupt data and fear mongering (specifically with HIV and MSM Men who have sex with men*I did not save the stat, I should have, when I comb through the dense reasearch papers again ill save the fishy ones*)* 
## Constraints
-  US specific info (state and county)
- filter out people under 18.
- age, sex organ , location

- how to anonymize data
  - -read the recommendations of Article 29 Working Party Opinion 5/2014 on anonymization.


## Data sources– 
- census data from the US to determine accurate total of relevant population
	https://databank.worldbank.org/census-data-US/id/edb87d62 
- data of how many people tested (what were they tested for? Positive or negative)
  - labs that do all the testing for STIs
  - college clinics 






# Add anything else to event flow—	

## Structural app additions-- 
1. section for people to upload their test results, 
2. a place to keep all records in one place, 
3. some sort of “I just got tested!” badge
4. About me: section on profile
    - General likes and dislikes
    - In my toy stash
    - Favorite kinks
    - “I’m curious about…”

Data retention must comply with the proportionality principle.
Proportionality is defined like this, in the Data Protection Directive:
Personal data may be processed only insofar as it is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed. The data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified; The data shouldn't be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use.” [5]

* WSM = women who have sex with men
* WSW = women sex with women
* MSW = men who have sex with women only. 
* AFAB = Assigned Female at Birth

- Raw data that the app has obtained from sensors, which is processed by the app and can be used independently or combined with other data to come to a conclusion about the user’s health status or potential health risks.
- where conclusions can be drawn about the user’s health status or health risks based on information gathered by the app 
- information derived from the testing or examination of a body part of a bodily substance, information about disease risks and information about the actual physiological or biomedical state of an individual independent of its source.
- tracking information over time that seems to be insignificant in itself could be considered health data if it is combined with other data
- it must be possible to show the relationship between information collected and the ability to establish the health of an individual, based on the information on its own or on combination with other data” [6]

- telehealth professionals 
- expedited partner therapy (if one person tests positive, they can deliver prescriptions for an STI to their partner(s) without the partner(s) having to visit a doctor personally. “legal”ish)
